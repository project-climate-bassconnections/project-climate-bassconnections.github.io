Project title idea:
- Project C.L.I.M.A.T.E: The Heat Exposure and Assessment Team monitoring temperature and vulnerability across Sri Lanka.

## Background

Heat stress is a critical health threat, and its risk and prevalence increase as our climate warms. Small island nations are particularly vulnerable to the threats of climate change. A key example of this is the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) linked to heat stress in Sri Lanka, an island nation undergoing complex and significant changes in historical temperature patterns. These changes expose vulnerable communities to the threats of climate change.

There is an urgent need for technical advances and new research on understanding and addressing heat stress. However, one significant knowledge gap in addressing heat exposure is the lack of high-resolution temperature data, especially in low- and middle-income communities.

Building on the work of a previous team, this project will...
