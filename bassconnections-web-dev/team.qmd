Dr. Jayasundara is an Assistant Professor of Global Environmental Health. His research focuses on how environmental change impacts human and ecological health. Over the past five years, he has worked extensively in Sri Lanka, particularly in communities experiencing a rising prevalence of kidney disease associated with heat exposure and agrochemical use. As a natural scientist, Dr. Jayasundara is eager to learn how community-based participatory research can deepen our understanding of disease mechanisms and guide the development of effective, locally informed interventions.

Comm Engage & Envrn Jus (Mgmt); Ecotoxi & Environ Health (Env)

Beatrix is a graduate student of the Master of Environmental Management program at Nicholas School of the Environment, concentrating in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Health (EEH) and Community Engagement and Environmental Justice (CEEJ). In this project, Beatrix hopes to discover how local environmental health knowledge could be best communicated to local communities, and how environmental science could benefit community livelihoods.

### Cammie Moore

Cammie is a second-year Master of Environmental Management (MEM) student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment concentrating in freshwater ecosystems and environmental data science. Last summer, she worked as a Business Plan Intern (BPI) with the National Park Service, where she analyzed historical visitor data and spatial (GIS) data. She is passionate about reducing wealth inequality and promoting a healthy climate. In this project, Cammie hopes to build qualitative research skills while increasing her understanding of heat stress. Cammie grew up in Belton, Texas, and holds a B.A. with Honors in Interdisciplinary Studies focusing on economics, government, and geography from the University of Texas at Austin.

## Undergraduate Team Members

### Natasha Harris

Natasha is an undergraduate sophomore studying Statistical Science and Public Policy. She is particularly drawn to this Bass Connections project for its focus on heat stress and its implications for vulnerable communities. Through this project, Natasha hopes to deepen her applied data analysis and research skills while gaining a stronger understanding of how both quantitative and qualitative research can inform policy responses to climate-related inequities. Natasha is also interested in learning more about how community based participatory research can effect change.

### Imadh Mashoor

Imadh, an undergraduate junior studying electrial engineering and biomedical engineering, is thrilled to help analyze health narratives in his home country of Sri Lanka to better understand their larger implications for health equity and policy within communities.

### Natalie Jones

Natalie is an undergraduate sophomore studying Biology and Health Policy. As an undergraduate researcher, she hopes to engage in community-based research, focusing on the impacts of climate-induced chronic kidney disease in women and children. She hopes to use this research to inform policy recommendations in Sri Lanka. In her free time, she enjoys practicing Spanish, trying various herbal teas, singing, and scuba diving!
