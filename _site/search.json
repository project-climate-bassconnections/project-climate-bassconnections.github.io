In this project, Beatrix hopes to discover how local environmental health knowledge could be best communicated to local communities, and how environmental science could benefit community livelihoods.\n\n\nCammie Moore\n\n\n\nTerrestrial and Freshwater Environments, Environmental Analytics and Modeling (Management)\n\n\nCammie is a second-year Master of Environmental Management (MEM) student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment concentrating in freshwater ecosystems and environmental data science. Last summer, she worked as a Business Plan Intern (BPI) with the National Park Service, where she analyzed historical visitor data and spatial (GIS) data. She is passionate about reducing wealth inequality and promoting a healthy climate. In this project, Cammie hopes to build qualitative research skills while increasing her understanding of heat stress. Cammie grew up in Belton, Texas, and holds a B.A. with Honors in Interdisciplinary Studies focusing on economics, government, and geography from the University of Texas at Austin."

She is particularly drawn to this Bass Connections project for its focus on heat stress and its implications for vulnerable communities. Through this project, Natasha hopes to deepen her applied data analysis and research skills while gaining a stronger understanding of how both quantitative and qualitative research can inform policy responses to climate-related inequities. Natasha is also interested in learning more about how community based participatory research can effect change.\n\n\nImadh Mashoor\n\n\n\nElectrical & Computer Egineering (BSE), Biomedical Engineering (BSE2)\n\n\nImadh, an undergraduate junior studying electrial engineering and biomedical engineering, is thrilled to help analyze health narratives in his home country of Sri Lanka to better understand their larger implications for health equity and policy within communities.\n\n\nNatalie Jones\n\n\n\nBiology (BS), Global Health\n\n\nNatalie is an undergraduate sophomore studying Biology and Health Policy. As an undergraduate researcher, she hopes to engage in community-based research, focusing on the impacts of climate-induced chronic kidney disease in women and children. She hopes to use this research to inform policy recommendations in Sri Lanka. In her free time, she enjoys practicing Spanish, trying various herbal teas, singing, and scuba diving!"

    "text": "Background\nHeat stress is a critical health threat, and its risk and prevalence increase as our climate warms. Small island nations are particularly vulnerable to the threats of climate change. A key example of this is the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) linked to heat stress in Sri Lanka, an island nation undergoing complex and significant changes in historical temperature patterns. These changes expose vulnerable communities to the threats of climate change.\nThere is an urgent need for technical advances and new research on understanding and addressing heat stress. However, one significant knowledge gap in addressing heat exposure is the lack of high-resolution temperature data, especially in low- and middle-income communities."

In partnership with Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Health, the team will use findings to inform heat exposure guidelines for outdoor workers. Building on previous data collection efforts, the 2025-2026 team will add a strong social science component through socioeconomic surveys, vulnerability mapping, and community-engaged research in kidney disease-affected regions, culminating in a four-week immersive field experience in Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\n\n\nA dialysis unit at a teaching hospital in Batticaloa.
